# Victor - Voice Input Controller

Victor is an free cross-platform programmable voice control program for desktops that is currently in the early stages of development. Victor was started during my entry into the [Mozilla Voice Challenge](https://www.herox.com/voice) to test some ideas for an integrated open-source voice stack and currently uses the following open-source projects:

* Julius (ASR)
* SnipsNLU (NLU)
* Mimic (TTS)

The current release is v0.1.1 and can be downloaded from the [release page](https://github.com/allisterb/Victor/releases/tag/v0.1.1).

The following videos are available demoing and documenting some aspects of Victor (click the screenshot to go to the YouTube video):
